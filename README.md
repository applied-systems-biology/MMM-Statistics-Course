These are the exercise files for the Statistics Course of the RTG MMM (https://www.mmm.uni-jena.de/) given 28-29 April in Jena Germany. The course was given by Dr. Carl-Magnus Svensson for the Research Group Applied Systems Biology lead by Prof. Marc Thilo Figge, Leibniz-HKI.

The course assumes that you have RStudio installed on your computer so that you have see and build the RMarkdown files. The code is developed at RStudio 2024.12.1 with R 4.4.1. It should also work on newer versions and R>4.0. 
The intended order of working through the files is to start with Plotting_R_script.R and then work through the Rmd files in order of the prefix, 1_Plotting_R_Markdown.Rmd followed by 2_T-test_basics.Rmd and so on.

Each Rmd is stand alone. There is no absolute need to do them in order if you want to explore a specific topic.

The "students" data file is a copy from "https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/soga/data/raw-data/students.csv" and is a backup in case the page would be taken down or you want to work offline.

At the second day of the course, "Solutions.Rmd" will be made available with suggestions for the main exercises asked for.
